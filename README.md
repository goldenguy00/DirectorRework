# Director Rework

A continuation of Nuxlar's Director Rework, alongside Moffeins affix stacking idea from Artifact of Cruelty. Go check out the originals below.

- Multiple enemy types per wave
- Multiple elite affixes on enemies
- Modifies director to be more fast paced
- Config options with RiskOfOptions support to fine tune the spawn logic.

Fully configurable, and turning off stuff will actually prevent it from loading entirely. Anything not marked with "(Restart required)" can be updated during the run.

Includes config section to modify various input values used by the combat director. Limited scope for now. More to come.

All code is written by me, and no assets taken. I'm a thief of the intellectual property variety.
