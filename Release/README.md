# Director Rework

A continuation of Nuxlar's Director Rework, alongside Moffeins affix stacking idea from Artifact of Cruelty. Go check out the originals below.

- Multiple enemy types per wave
- Multiple elite affixes on enemies
- Modifies director to be more fast paced
- Default settings are tuned to be balanced 

Fully configurable and will apply modifications immediately (host only), and turning off features will remove the hooks entirely.
- Config options with RiskOfOptions support to fine tune the spawn logic.
- Over two dozen config options to modify the enemy spawns to your liking!

### _Director Control_

Includes config section to modify various input values used by the combat director.

Default values are tuned to make the early game pacing faster and to work well with spawn diversity and elite affix stacking. Vanilla values are listed but arent always default.

    "Director credits are set to 1.0x by default, because the mod is set up to increase spawning through less brute-force methods."
    "ITS RECOMMENDED TO SET ALL OTHER MODS TO 1.0x !!!",

### Additional Dependencies

Elite Reworks and Risk of Options are both listed as dependencies, and should be downloaded alongside this mod for the intended experience.

Both mods can be removed without any issue if you'd like, since there's nothing in this mod that _actually_ needs them installed.

All code is written by me, and no assets taken. I'm a thief of the intellectual property variety.
